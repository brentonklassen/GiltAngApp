<h2>These are the details</h2>
<p>I created this app to try out <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>, <a href="http://purecss.io/">Pure</a>, and <a href="http://www.gilt.com/">Gilt</a>'s API. I developed it over Christmas break using only Notepad since I didn't have my laptop with me and I didn't have admin rights on the desktop that I was using.</p>
<p>I loaded in AngularJS, AngularJS routes, Pure, and Pure responsive. I think I'm proabably doing something wrong with the way I'm initializing the data in my controllers, but I don't know the best practices yet.</p>
